# Introduction to Machine Learning
**Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel**

An introductory code to the world of machine- and statistical learning, aimed for undergraduate students of computer science. The following repository contains:
1) Course Book - Based on lecture- and recitation notes
2) Code examples and graphs generating code, used throughout the book
3) Hands-on guided labs to experience aspects discussed in lectures and recitations
4) Skeleton files for software package ``IMLearn`` developed throughout the course
5) Skeleton files for course exercises


## Setting Up Code and Labs Environment
Set a local copy of this GitHub repository. Do so by [forking and cloning the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) or [cloning the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) using GitBash and 
```
cd LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH
git clone https://github.com/GreenGilad/IML.HUJI.git
```

or by downloading and unzipping it in `LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH`. Then:

### Anaconda + Jupyter Notebooks Setup
- Download and install Anaconda from [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads). 
- Verify instllation by starting the Anaconda Prompt. A terminal should start with the text `(base)` written at the beginning of the line.
- Set the IML conda environment. Start the Anaconda Prompt and write:
  ```
  conda env create -f "LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH\environment.yml"
  ```
  This will create a conda envoronment named `iml.env` with the specifications defined in `environment.yml`. If creating failed due to `ResolvePackageNotFound: plotly-orca` remove this line from environment file, create environment without, and then after activating environment run:
  ```
  conda install -c plotly plotly-orca
  ```
- Activate the environment by `conda activate iml.env`.
- To open one of the Jupyter notebooks:
  ```
  jupyter notebook "LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH\lab\Lab 00 - A - Data Analysis In Python - First Steps.ipynb"
  ```

### Using PyCharm
Another option is to run the Jupyter notebooks through the PyCharm IDE plug-in. 
- Install the PyCharm IDE (professional edition) as described on the [Install PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) page. Be sure to install the Jupyter plug-in.
- Follow the [Configure a Conda virtual environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html#conda-requirements) page.
- Open a PyCharm project from `LOCAL_REPOSITORY` and set the project's interpreter to be the `iml.env` environment.

### Using Google Colab
One can also view and run the labs and code examples via Google Colab. It supports loading and running Jupyter notebooks and running using a specified Conda environemnt.
